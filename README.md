# hello-world
I'm just starting out! Looking to learn a lot!
I am a coding newbie, but as a teacher, I consider myself a life-long learner. I want to explore where coding can take me as I consider a career change.
I had my initial interview with Flatiron School today (June 3). While I wait for their decision, I'm working on their bootcamp-prep material.
